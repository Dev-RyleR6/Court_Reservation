# Court_Reservation
Our Final Project on Object Oriented Programming
The Court Reservation System is a desktop application built with Java, Swing, and SQL for managing court bookings efficiently. It allows users to reserve time slots, view availability, and avoid scheduling conflicts. Administrators can manage courts, view reservations, and maintain the system with ease. The system ensures smooth, conflict-free bookings and stores all data securely in a database.

The Court Reservation System uses a modular structure with **Java Swing for the UI**, **DAO classes for database operations**, **model classes for data representation**, and **MySQL Connector/J v5** for connecting to a MySQL database.
